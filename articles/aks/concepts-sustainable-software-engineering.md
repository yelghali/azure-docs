# Sustainable software engineering practices in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

The sustainable software engineering principles are a set of competencies to help you define, build, and run sustainable applications. The overall goal is to reduce the carbon footprint in every aspect of your application. [The Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering][principles-sse] has an overview of the principles of sustainable software engineering.

Sustainable software engineering is a shift in priorities and focus. In many cases, the way most software is designed and run highlights fast performance and low latency. Meanwhile, sustainable software engineering focuses on reducing as much carbon emission as possible. Consider:

* Applying sustainable software engineering principles can give you faster performance or lower latency, such as by lowering total network travel. 
* Reducing carbon emissions may cause slower performance or increased latency, such as delaying low-priority workloads. 

The [sustainability guidance in the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF)](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/) aims to address the challenges of building sustainable workloads on Azure.

This article provides practical recommendations for applying WAF sustainability guidance for AKS.

## Get started with WAF sustainability guidance

* [What is a sustainable workload](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/sustainability-get-started)
* [Design Methodology for building sustainable workloads](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/sustainability-design-methodology)
* [Design principles of a sustainable workload](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/sustainability-design-principles)


## Key sustainability Design Areas

Sustainable guidance in the Well Architected Framework series is composed of architectural considerations and recommendations oriented around these key design areas.

Decisions made in one design area can impact or influence decisions across the entire design. The focus is ultimately on building a sustainable solution to minimize the footprint and impact on the environment.

|Design area|Description|
|---|---|
|[Application design](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/sustainability-application-design.md)|Cloud application patterns that allow for designing sustainable workloads.|
|[Application platform](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/sustainability-application-platform.md)|Choices around hosting environment, dependencies, frameworks, and libraries.|
|[Testing](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/sustainability-testing.md)|Strategies for CI/CD pipelines and automation, and how to deliver more sustainable software testing.|
|[Operational procedures](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/sustainability-operational-procedures.md)|Processes related to sustainable operations.|
|[Storage](sustainability-storage.md)|Design choices for making the data storage options more sustainable.|
|[Network and connectivity](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/sustainability-networking.md)|Networking considerations that can help reduce traffic and amount of data transmitted to and from the application.|
|[Security](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/sustainability-security.md)|Relevant recommendations to design more efficient security solutions on Azure.|

We recommend that readers familiarize themselves with these design areas, reviewing provided considerations and recommendations to better understand the consequences of encompassed decisions.

## Sustainability Design considerations for AKS workloads and clusters
 -  Sustainability considerations for your AKS workloads (or applications), **should cover the All Key Sustainability Design Areas**

 -  In practice, you should consider the hollistic lifecycle of your application, as Business requiements shape Workload design, which will inform cluster design
 
 - The following tables maps sustainability design areas, with sustainability design considerations for AKS workloads and clusters.
  
|Design area|Scope for AKS|
|---|---|

|Application platform|**AKS cluster is the Platform**: Design cluster for energy and hardware efficiency|
|Testing|**cluster and workloads**: Optimize Testing procedures for Cluster & workload development lifecycle|
|_Operational procedures_|Implement sustainability operations (not a technical consideration) |
|Storage|**cluster and workloads**: Consider _Stateless Vs Stateful Application_ Design ; Plan for storage classes & Backup retention policies.|

|Security| **cluster and workloads**: Implement Security controls and Optimize log collection for Monitoring & SIEM.|


## Cloud efficiency
Making workloads more [sustainable and cloud efficient](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/sustainability-get-started#cloud-efficiency-overview), requires combining efforts around cost optimization, reducing carbon emissions, and optimizing energy consumption. Optimizing the application's cost is the initial step in making workloads more sustainable.


## For Product Teams: Sustainability Checklist for AKS workloads

The following checklist provides recommendations for designing sustainable workloads, hosted on AKS. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As your workload End2End architecture would typically include several Azure services (or 3rd party integration), your workload design considerations should refer to [Sustainability Design areas](#key-sustainability-design-areas), for a more comprehensive approach.
